### Simple Redux Example

This project deviates from [simplest-redux-example](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example) and begins 
to separate files into folders. For such a simple app it's probably overkill.

There's an additional button to decrease the counter and another h1 label.

To run this example:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. open http://localhost:8000/ in the browser

Inspired by [simplest-redux-example](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example)
